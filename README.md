# RedWithoutRose_gameincubator
A short 2D narrative game developed by Narrative Without Words group in CU Game Incubator, inspired by the folklore of Little Red RidingHood.  Collect the flower, avoid the wolf, and reach home for grandma.  This project focuses on Color as narrative progression and Player movement as emotional expression.
